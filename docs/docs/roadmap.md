# 🚀 Roadmap

AgentGPT is currently in beta and we have a lot of features planned. Here's a glimpse of whats in the works!

## Features in development ⏳

:::tip
AgentGPT developers are actively working on the following. Expect these to take anywhere from a few days to 2 weeks.
:::

For the most up-to-date information on the current
roadmap, [visit our roadmap board on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/reworkd/projects/3).

## Finished features ✔

- 🔐 **Users and authentication**
- 💾 **Saving and sharing agent runs**
  - If you are signed in, after your agent run has finished you have the ability to save it to our database.
- 🌐 **Dynamic translations for multiple languages**
  - AgentGPT is used worldwide, and we want to ensure everyone has a seamless experience on the platform. If we are
    missing the translation for your language, we'd love your help in getting it implemented!
- 🤖 **AI Model customization**
  - Now users have the ability to use their own OpenAI API key to customize everything from the model, temperature,
    loops, and more! This also all runs directly within the user's browser!
- 📚 **Documentation overhaul**
  - This is the page you're viewing right now! It will continually be updated as the project evolves to allow any new
    user / contributer to get familiar with AgentGPT as quickly as possible.
- 🌐 **Web browsing capabilities**
  - We have a basic version implemented that performs and summarizes a Google search via the SERP api.
  - This does not currently visit the websites themselves and parse websites but we are working on this.
- ✈ **Backend migration to Python**
  - This is a bigger undertaking but something we feel must be done. It will allow us to migrate off of edge functions
    and use all the tools available for language models in the Python ecosystem.
- 💵 **Stripe integration for a lower limit paid version**
  - (Will help us stop worrying about infra costs)

## Planned features 🕰️

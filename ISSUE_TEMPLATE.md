Remember, an issue is not the place to ask questions. You can use [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/angular-meteor) for that, or you may want to start a discussion on the [Meteor forum](https://forums.meteor.com/).

Before you open an issue, please check if a similar issue already exists or has been closed before.

### When reporting a bug, please be sure to include the following:
- [ ] A descriptive title
- [ ] An *isolated* way to reproduce the behavior (example: GitHub repository with code isolated to the issue that anyone can clone to observe the problem)
- [ ] What version of `angular-meteor` you're using, and the platform(s) you're running it on
- [ ] What packages or other dependencies you're using
- [ ] The behavior you expect to see, and the actual behavior

See [here](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-a-bug-in-meteor) for more detail on what is expected of a bug report.

### When you open an issue for a feature request, please add as much detail as possible:
- [ ] A descriptive title
- [ ] A description of the problem you're trying to solve, including *why* you think this is a problem
- [ ] An overview of the suggested solution
- [ ] If the feature changes current behavior, reasons why your solution is better

See [here](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/CONTRIBUTING.md#feature-requests) for more detail on what is expected of a feature request.
